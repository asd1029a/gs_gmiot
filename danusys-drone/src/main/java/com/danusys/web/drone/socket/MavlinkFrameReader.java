 * according to the specified length, protocol version, and incompatibility flags (signature,
 * for instance).
 * <p>

 * began with a valid STX. Any long enough sequence of bytes which begins a valid STX will be
 * returned as a frame by this reader. Therefore, users of this class are required to understand
 * and CRC check the returned frames, issuing calls to {@link #drop()} when validation fails.
